#   Custom dictionaries support a few special characters:
# ! is a prefix that forbids a word — use -ban.txt files for those.
# * is a prefix/suffix that tells the spell checker that a word can be combined with another word.
# + is a prefix/suffix that tells the spell checker that a word MUST be combined with another word to be valid.
# ~ is a prefix that tells the spell checker to only use the word when case sensitivity is turned off.
